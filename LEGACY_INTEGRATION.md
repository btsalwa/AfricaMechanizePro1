- `legacy_config_choices` - Configuration and choice systems  
- `legacy_menu_structure` - Navigation hierarchy
- `legacy_gallery` - Media file management
- `legacy_cache_data` - Performance caching system
- `legacy_registrations` - Application and form submissions
- `legacy_projects` - Project and initiative tracking

#### Data Preservation Strategy
- **Admin Accounts:** Successfully imported 3 legacy admin accounts with preserved usernames and access levels
- **Content Structure:** Maintained hierarchical content organization
- **Multi-language Support:** Preserved English/French content framework
- **SEO Optimization:** Maintained SEO-friendly URL structures and meta data

#### API Integration
- **Migration Endpoints:** 
  - `POST /api/migration/import-legacy-data` - Execute data migration
  - `GET /api/migration/status` - Check migration status
- **Legacy Data Access:** Methods to access imported legacy data through existing admin interface

### Technical Achievements
